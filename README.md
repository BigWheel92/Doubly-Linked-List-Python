# Doubly-Linked-List-Python

The implementation of doubly linked list is placed in DataStructures.py. The head and the tail are stored in member variables. The following methods for doubly linked lists have been implemented:

1. __init__  (initalizes the head and the tail of the list with None)
2. insertAtHead
3. insertAtTail
4. deleteFromHead
5. deleteFromTail
6. reverse (reverses the contents of the list, i.e., 1, 2, 3 becomes 3, 2, 1)
7. removeDuplicates (removes duplicate elements from the list, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 becomes 1, 2, 3)
8. print (prints the elements of the list)
